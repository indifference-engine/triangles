# Lines

C library to draw triangles.

## Usage

### Project Level

Your application's build pipeline will need to be configured to compile each C
file in the [src](./src) directory and recompile every C file should any H files
change.  Then, include each H file in the same directory to make its
corresponding function available.

### Assumptions

- The compilation environment supports C99.
- The texture being sampled from:
  - Has its origin in the top left corner.
  - Is row-major.
  - Is planar (not interleaved).
  - Has a red plane.
  - Has a green plane.
  - Has a blue plane.
  - Has an opacity plane (where required).
  - Uses 32-bit floats for all planes.
  - Describes more distant pixels using greater depth values.
  - Describes absolute transparency as an opacity of 0.
  - Describes absolute opacity as an opacity of 1.
  - Does not pre-multiply any plane by the opacity plane.
- The viewport being rendered to:
  - Has its origin in the top left corner.
  - Is row-major.
  - Is planar (not interleaved).
  - Has a red plane.
  - Has a green plane.
  - Has a blue plane.
  - Has an opacity plane.
  - Has a depth plane.
  - Uses 32-bit floats for all planes.
  - Describes more distant pixels using greater depth values.
  - Describes absolute transparency as an opacity of 0.
  - Describes absolute opacity as an opacity of 1.
  - Does not pre-multiply any plane by the opacity plane.
- No float arguments:
  - Are NaN.
  - Are infinity.
  - Are negative infinity.
  - Cannot be cast to `int` without undefined behavior (for example, very large
    values).

### Blend Modes

| Blend Mode | Color                                           | Opacity             | Depth        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Opaque     | Overwritten without mixing with existing color. | Overwritten with 1. | Overwritten. |

### Functions

| Name            | Blend Mode |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| `opaque_line`   | Opaque     |

## Tests

Execute `make` to run the test suite.

### Dependencies
